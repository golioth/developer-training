# Console Signup and Exploration

This section includes references to [the Golioth docs site](https://docs.golioth.io/). We are linking you there so you have the most up-to-date directions on getting started with the Golioth Cloud. Once you have completed a section, you will come back to this page for further instructions.

## Learning Objectives

This section is to get you signed up with a Golioth account, which is required for getting credentials so your device can authenticate to Golioth and later accessing device data on the Console. There is a 'wizard' that will guide you through creating your first device on the platform.

### Desired Outcome 

* Understand how to add a single device to the console
* Be able to access the credentials for use on your device.
### Time Estimate
* 5 minutes

## Signup and Provision your first device

import GoliothRegister from './_partials/2-register.md'

<GoliothRegister/>

## Manage Devices

import GoliothManage from './_partials/3-manage-devices.md'

<GoliothManage/>

## Authorize Devices

import GoliothAuthorize from './_partials/4-authorize-devices.md'

<GoliothAuthorize/>


## Additional exercises

* Create a "fleet" of 5 devices with unique credentials for each.
* See how the menus are set up and what features exist on the Golioth [Console](https://console.golioth.io).
* Attempt to add a "tag" and a "blueprint" to your [Console](https://console.golioth.io).

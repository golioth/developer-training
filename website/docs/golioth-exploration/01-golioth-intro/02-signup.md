# Console Signup and Exploration

## Learning Objectives

This section guides you through the Golioth account creation process. You need
an account in order to generate credentials so your device can authenticate with
Golioth.

With the Golioth Dev tier, your first 50 devices are free. There is a 'wizard'
that will guide you through creating your first device on the platform.

* **Desired outcome(s)**
  1. Understand how to add a single device to the console
  2. Be able to access the credentials for use on your device.
* **Time Estimate:** 5 minutes

## Signup and Provision your first device

import GoliothRegister from './_partials/2-register.md'

<GoliothRegister/>

## Manage Devices

import GoliothManage from './_partials/3-manage-devices.md'

<GoliothManage/>

:::note

The wizard offers links for different hardware choices at the end. These are
convenience links to the Golioth Docs and are not an indication/limitation to
the types of hardware that may be used with the device credentials you just
created.

:::

## Authorize Devices

import GoliothAuthorize from './_partials/4-authorize-devices.md'

<GoliothAuthorize/>


## Additional exercises

* Create a "fleet" of 5 devices with unique credentials for each.
* See how the menus are set up and what features exist on the Golioth [Console](https://console.golioth.io).
* Attempt to add a "tag" and a "blueprint" to your [Console](https://console.golioth.io).

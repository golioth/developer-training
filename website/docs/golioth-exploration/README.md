# Intro to Golioth

## What is this training all about?

This module is a training tool where you'll learn about Golioth and the services
available through hands-on exploration.

Instructors are here to offer a guiding hand and to answer questions live. In
the event you're taking this training asynchronously, utilize [the Golioth
forum](https://forum.golioth.io) if you find you are stuck.

## How can you use this information in your work?

Developers who successfully complete this training will understand how Golioth
makes it possible to control and communicate with an IoT hardware fleet of any
size.

* Understand the interface options in the Golioth Web Console
* Flash pre-compiled firmware to a device
* Provision the device with credentials to securely connect to the Golioth Cloud
* Send time-series data and stateful data
* View device logs remotely
* Update fleet settings
* Issue a Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
* Gain an overview of the Over-the-Air (OTA) update features

## Do I need hardware?

We recommend that you use a Nordic nRF7002 Development Kit (nRF7002 DK) or a
Nordic nRF9160 Development Kit (nRF9160 DK) as the Target device during this
training. We will walk through how to download a pre-compiled binary, flash it
to the device, and add your Golioth credentials so that it can connect. You will
interact with this board while learning about the Golioth services.

:::info Sample code repository

This module uses a pre-compiled binary that you will download as you work your
way through the training. Source code for this binary is available in 01_IOT
folder of [the zephyr-training
repository](https://github.com/golioth/zephyr-training) on GitHub.

# Interacting with Devices

With the nRF7002-DK/nRF9160-DK running, it's easy to view the live data and
control your device fleet from Golioth's Web Console. For these exercises, log
into [your Golioth Web Console](https://console.golioth.io).

This section uses the data coming in from the hardware to demonstrate how to use
the Golioth console. In addition to viewing data, you will learn how to control
device settings and issue remote procedure calls.

# Zephry Training Overview

## Your Quickstart for Zephyr RTOS

In this section you'll learn the basics of what makes up Zephyr RTOS and how
major components are used when developing applications. You'll work through
severl hands-on examples designed to explore common elements for new developers.

* Learn about Zephyr SDK, Zephyr Tree, Devicetree, Kconfig, CMake, etc.
* Compile and run Hello World; add feature using menuconfig
* Map an LED in a Devicetree overlay file
* Blink and LED using Zephyr's timer and thread features

This section will take about 120 minutes to complete.

the event you're taking this training asynchronously, utilize [our
forum](https://forum.golioth.io) and [our Discord
channel](https://golioth.io/discord) if you find you are stuck.

## How can you use this information in your work?

Developers who successfully complete this training will understand that major
components that make up the Zephyr ecosystem and how to use them during
application development. The training exercises help to build a muscle memory
for the build and flash process, and provide an opportunity to implement
rudimentary features for a better understanding of the RTOS. These skill
directly apply to application development for your business.

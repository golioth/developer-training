# Map an LED using Devicetree

In this module we will use a Devicetree overlay file to map an LED. This is the
perfect opportunity to dig into the secret to Zephyr's hardware abstraction.
Along the way you will learn:

* A general overview of what Devicetree does
* Learn where to look in the Zephyr tree to find existing Devicetree definitions
* Gain exposure to how Devicetree nodes work
* Learn how to access Devicetree nodes from C code

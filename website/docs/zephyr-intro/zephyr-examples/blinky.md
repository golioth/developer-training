# Blinky Example

The Blinky example is the most basic application possible&ndash;one blinking LED. It shows that your toolchain is capable of building code correctly, that you are able to flash a binary to the device, and that the device runs the binary as expected.

1. Go to your local copy of [the magtag-demo repository](https://github.com/golioth/magtag-demo) and checkout the `blinky` example:

    ```bash
    cd ~/magtag-training/app
    git checkout blinky
    ```

2. Build the example

    ```bash
    west build -b esp32s2_saola . -p
    ```

3. Flash the example

    ![MagTag Boot0 and Reset buttons](../assets/magtag-bootloader-mode.jpg)

    Put the MagTag into DFU bootloader mode

    1. Hold down the Boot0 button
    2. Press and release the Reset button

    Type the following command to start the firmware upgrade

    ```bash
    west flash
    ```

:::note
If the flash is successful, **you will receive an error message** telling you that you must manually reset the device. Remember to press the reset button to run the newly flashed program. [Learn more about this](../zephyr-tips#you-must-press-the-reset-button-after-flashing-firmware).

On some machines you will only have a few seconds to run the `west flash` command after entering bootloader mode. [Learn more about this](../zephyr-tips.md#errors-with-west-build-zephyr-tree-and-esp32-environmental-variables).

## Expected Results

![MagTag LED on pin D13](../../basic-io-exercises/assets/d13-LED.jpg)

The Blinky app will make the red LED on the underside of the MagTag board blink on and off about once every two seconds.

## Challenge: Modifying Blinky

* Find the source files for blinky. 
* Modify the blink period in the source files 
* Recompile/reflash -- Try leaving off the `-p` command for a faster recompile.

### Questions:
1. What do you notice about directory structure for Zephyr projects?

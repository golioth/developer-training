# Code Examples 

The code examples take trainees through the basics of using the Golioth platform, while also learning a bit more about Zephyr. Seeing working code allows users to investigate how the system works by looking at the benefits and drawbacks of the RTOS (more of the former!).

## Logistics

You will be going through the exercises below and then switching to different branches in the MagTag repo. Your credentials file will remain. If you are newer to revision control and development branches using Git, feel free to reach out to the instructors (or the forum, for those taking this training asynchronously).

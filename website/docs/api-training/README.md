# API Training Overview

## Using Golioth OpenAPI

In this section you'll expore the Golioth REST API using the OpenAPI tool on our
documentation page.

* Get a list of devices and their status information for your fleet
* Query for time-searies data received from your devices
* Control your fleet using API calls
* Learn how to look under the hood of the Golioth Web Console&mdash;everything
  you see there is available to you via the REST API.

This section will take about 40 minutes to complete.

Instructors are here to offer a guiding hand and to answer questions live. In
the event you're taking this training asynchronously, utilize [our
forum](https://forum.golioth.io) and [our Discord
channel](https://golioth.io/discord) if you find you are stuck.

## How can you use this information in your work?

Developers who successfully complete this training should be able to interact
with IoT devices in the field and query the data they have sent (and are
currently sending) back to the Golioth servers. Although the training modules
illustrate rudimentary API calls, the skills extend to developing completely
custom dashboards/apps/interfaces and interacting with stored and live data in
every way necessary for your business.

:::tip Prerequisites

You must complete the [**Intro to Golioth**](/docs/golioth-exploration) section
prior to beginning the API Training module. This module utilizes the device you
set up during the exploration to learn about data monitoring and fleet control.

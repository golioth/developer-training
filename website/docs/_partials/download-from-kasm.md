![How to download binaries from Kasm](./assets/kasm_download_binary.png)

Because Kasm is a virtual machine running in the cloud, we can not directly
program the device connected to your local machine. Instead, we will download
the binary so that your local machine can program that file to the device in the
next step.

The filename includes the folder name of the app you built, along with a
timestamp. So your download will look something like this:
`zephyr_02_hellowworld_222520.hex`.

The image above shows the left sidebar menu of Kasm with the Download widget
selected. Click the "DOWNLOAD" button next to the
`zephyr_<appfolder>_<hhmmss>.hex` file to download your recently compiled code.

        :::caution Your Mileage May Vary

        There are a couple of "gotchas" you should keep in mind when working with
        this serial terminal:

        * When choosing your device, device names sometimes change. At times you
          will see names like "nRF7002 DK" or "nRF9160" but other times you will
          see "J-Link"
        * Serial ports vary by device:
           * For the nRF7002 DK, select the second of two serial port options
           * For the nRF9160 DK, select the first of three serial port options
